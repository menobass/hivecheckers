# HiveCheckers: A Decentralized Turn-Based Game on Hive Blockchain

## Abstract

HiveCheckers is a lightweight, turn-based checkers game implemented as a browser extension, using the Hive blockchain as the back-end for all game logic, state storage, and identity verification. The game requires no centralized servers, relies on Hive's social infrastructure for matchmaking and game tracking, and uses Keychain for player authentication. This white paper outlines the system design, user experience, technical architecture, and operational considerations for HiveCheckers.

## Goals

* Provide a decentralized checkers game playable directly from a browser extension
* Use Hive's comment system as a distributed game state ledger
* Eliminate the need for centralized storage or servers
* Ensure moves are transparent, verifiable, and immutable
* Encourage Hive community engagement and gamification

---

## Core Concepts

### Game Model

* **Turn-based checkers**
* **Player vs Player** format
* All game interactions happen as Hive posts/comments

### Hive as a Game State Engine

* **Parent Post** = Game initiation (challenge request)
* **Top-level Reply** = Challenge accepted (game started)
* **Subsequent Replies** = Moves in alternating pattern
* **Winner Declaration** = Posted as a final reply by the initiator or through consensus by both players

---

## Architecture

### Browser Extension

* Written in JavaScript (React or Svelte recommended)
* Uses Hive Keychain for authentication and transaction signing
* Displays the current game board visually
* Handles game creation, acceptance, moves, and winner declaration

### Hive Blockchain

* Stores all move data as comments in a structured format
* Each move includes:

  ```
  MOVE: B6-A5
  TURN: 3
  STATE_HASH: abc123 (optional for integrity verification)
  ```
* Comment parsing is handled locally by the extension to reconstruct game state

---

## Game Lifecycle

### 1. Game Initiation

* Player A creates a parent post in the "HiveCheckers" community using the extension
* Title format: `Checkers Challenge - @playerA`
* Body format includes game ID, ruleset (e.g., 24-hour timeouts), and optional wager (future feature)

### 2. Challenge Acceptance

* Player B replies using the extension
* Reply includes an acceptance marker:

  ```
  ACCEPT: @playerB
  GAME_ID: [unique id derived from post]
  ```

### 3. Gameplay (Alternating Moves)

* Each move is a reply to the **previous move**, not the parent post, to avoid comment bloat
* Turn structure is enforced by the extension UI
* Comment includes:

  ```
  MOVE: E3-D4
  TURN: 5
  TIME: 2025-05-24T16:21:00Z
  ```
* Moves are validated by the extension before allowing submission

### 4. Win Declaration

* Final move can be marked with a winner tag:

  ```
  WINNER: @playerA
  METHOD: Resignation / Capture / Timeout
  ```
* Extension checks for validity and agreement from both sides, or allows manual override by the game initiator

---

## Preventing Comment Bloat

* **Comment threading model**: Each move is a reply to the previous move, not the parent post
* Depth is limited by Hive (255 levels), but practically this allows dozens of moves per game
* Game abandonment protocol: if no reply is received after 48 hours, game may be marked forfeited by default

---

## Security & Fairness

* Uses Hive Keychain for all game actions to ensure real-user verification
* Game state is open and reconstructable, ensuring transparency
* All moves are public; cheating is difficult without collusion and visible to all
* Extension will include basic illegal move prevention and game logic validation

---

## Community Features

* HiveCheckers Community will serve as:

  * Game lobby (view open challenges)
  * Spectator zone (watch games unfold)
  * Leaderboard (based on win history and ELO-like scoring)

### Future Features

* NFT player badges
* Token-based staking/wagering
* Tournaments hosted via structured comment trees
* Player reputation system

---

## Technical Stack

* **Frontend**: JavaScript (React or Svelte), Chrome Extension APIs
* **Hive API**: dhive, Hive Engine (optional), Hivesearcher for indexed game discovery
* **Authentication**: Hive Keychain (posting authority only)

---

## Risks and Limitations

* Keychain prompt fatigue: mitigated by clear UX
* Comment rate limits: need pacing for rapid players
* Abandonment: extension should offer timeout reminders and forfeit logic
* Abuse: spam controls and minimum HP requirements may be implemented

---

## Conclusion

HiveCheckers is a minimalistic yet robust decentralized game that showcases Hive's strengths as a social ledger. It provides an engaging way to use blockchain not just for finance or blogging, but for collaborative, turn-based play. It encourages daily interaction, community building, and decentralized ownership of game state — without servers or databases.

HiveCheckers aims to be the first of many Hive-native games that treat blockchain as more than a wallet — but as a living, social playground.
